 Genetic Algorithm for Schedule Optimization

The biggest learning from this project was the importance of thorough testing and verification when using AI-generated code. Many of the issues we encountered weren't immediately obvious but only became apparent when running the code with real data and observing its   behavior over many generations.  

Despite these challenges, the genetic algorithm approach proved effective for this complex scheduling problem. The final implementation successfully balances multiple competing constraints and produces reasonable schedules, demonstrating the value of evolutionary algorithms 
  for this class of problems where traditional optimization methods might be difficult to apply.
